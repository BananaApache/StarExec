Hi, Albert.

I emailed a couple times today about a pressing problem that I would like
you to prioritize over the copy from StarExec to StarDev task.  Did you
not see those emails?

Here is part of what I wrote:

  I am currently handling some emails from users who are claiming
  things are missing from StarExec, similar to that forum post that
  you responded to.  Can you fill me in on what was going on with
  that?  These users claim that all SMT-COMP jobs (from SMT ->
  Competitions and Evaluations -> ...) are missing, and related
  solvers and benchmarks.  I find it very hard to believe this is our
  bug.  I suspect a user was cleaning up something and accidentally
  deleted them (though this would still be a bit of a disaster for the
  SMT community, and we might have to invent some defensive mechanisms
  to prevent this in the future).  Still, we need to try to figure out
  if those data are still on the system or try to understand if a user
  deleted them.

  So trying to get to the bottom of this issue of supposedly missing
  stuff from SMT -> Comp. and Evals. -> ... has to become our top
  priority for the moment.  Can you try to investigate this?

And another message:

  Here they give a specific job id:

  Here is one example:

  Sorry, no idea, I just noticed it yesterday.

I am thinking you must not have seen my emails, because otherwise you would
have gotten back in touch with me about this.  So I am communicating a different
way... :-)
