Installation Notes

This document describes how to describe StarExec and its
dependencies on a Linux system. 


********************************** MySQL **************************************

StarExec depends on MySQL Community Server 5.5.49. It is possible that newer
versions may also work, but this can't be guaranteed. MySQL can be obtained
at

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

Clicking the button 'Looking for previous GA versions?' will allow you to
select version 5.5.49, and then you will need to select the appropriate
version based on the system you are installing on.



********************************** EMAIL **************************************

Starexec sends automated emails for several purposes, such as sending notifications
when new users are registered or sending weekly status updates. To do this, Starexec
requires an email address that it can send emails from. In starexec-config.xml,
the EMAIL_USER field should be set to the email address to send from, and EMAIL_PWD,
EMAIL_SMTP, and EMAIL_SMTP_PORT should be set as decribed.

Any email server that supports SMTP can be used, but the default settings included
in the config file show how to use a Gmail account. The EMAIL_SMTP field is set
correctly for Gmail, and the SMTP_PORT field is set to 587, as Starexec uses
TLS. You should be able to use any desired Gmail account by plugging in your own
account and password. Note that Gmail may initially block the Starexec app from
sending mail until you log onto your account and confirm the activity. Moreover,
you may need to go into your Gmail account settings and allow access from less
secure apps. Creating a fresh Gmail account for sole use by Starexec may be
beneficial if you do not want to change your settings.

Starexec has been tested using Gmail, but other email servers should also work
provided you look up the correct SMTP server and port. Various settings may
need to be changed in other email providers as well.
