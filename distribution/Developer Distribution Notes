These are a few steps that should be taken before releasing a Starexec distribution. This mostly consists
of deleting the few files that users do not need-- files that may contain Starexec passwords or which are
used only to deploy Starexec on our specific systems.

1) Remove org/starexec/config/starexec-config.xml and rename starexec-config-deploy.xml to starexec-config.xml.

2) Delete the files 'production.properties' and 'stardev.properties'

3) In the scripts-common directory, delete the stardeploy.sh, starjobs.sh, and updateSQL scripts.

4) Delete the local-properties directory.
