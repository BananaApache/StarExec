These are one-time steps we would need to take to get OAR up and running on
Starexec.

1) Create the queue column for resources. OAR does have a notion of associating
resources (nodes) with queues by default, but it does support custom attributes.
This basically adds a column for 'queue' to the resources table, helping us
enforce our 1-1 relationship between nodes and queues.

oarproperty -a queue -c


2) Create all.q, along with any other queues that are expected at the time
we're migrating to OAR. OAR may come with a few default queues of its own: these
should be deleted from the database. All Starexec queues should use the same
priority (1 is reasonable) and the same scheduling algorithm.
It is probably easiest to do this directly in the OAR database.

delete from queues; -- delete all existing OAR queues

-- insert a new queue. Repeat for any other necessary queues.
insert into queues values ('all.q', 1,'oar_sched_gnatt_with_timesharing', 'Active');

3) Add resources

TODO:

4) Disable OAR admission rules. Basically, OAR does a bunch of validation and
and chooses a bunch of defaults that we do not need for our purposes. Again
in the OAR database, we can just execute

update admission_rules SET enabled = 'NO';



TODO: Remove below
oarsub -q all.q -l /nodes=1 -p "queue='all.q'" subtest.sh
