# StarExec

StarExec is a cross community logic solving service developed at the University
of Iowa under the direction of principal investigators Aaron Stump (Iowa), Geoff
Sutcliffe (University of Miami), and Cesare Tinelli (Iowa).

Its main goal is to facilitate the experimental evaluation of logic solvers,
broadly understood as automated tools based on formal reasoning. The service is
designed to provide a single piece of storage and computing infrastructure to
logic solving communities and their members. It aims at reducing duplication of
effort and resources as well as enabling individual researchers or groups with
no access to comparable infrastructure.

StarExec allows

 * community organizers to store, manage and make available benchmark libraries;
 * competition organizers to run logic solver competitions; and
 * community members to perform comparative evaluations of logic solvers on
   public or private benchmark problems.
